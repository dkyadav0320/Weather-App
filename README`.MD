In completing the Weathr Forecast appication I have use HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. 
In this project a weather forecast UI is there which gives the details of the weather of a specific city.
If the city is not fun then it gives the message that city is not found.
I used Netlify to host the project as it provides easy deployement and serverless functions for projects.
